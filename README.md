# hello-new-world
A new beginning for my repository

Hello. I'm an Air Force veteran who is excited to make a career change into the tech world. I enjoyed creating a few simple WordPress sites and now I'd like to dig deeper into how to better understand the coding side of it and get paid for doing it. 

I enjoy the challenge of crossfit workouts as I work out at least 5 times a week. Some people look at that as torture, I look at it as FUN! :) 

Have a fantastic day!!!
